I have been a Linux user for almost 7 years. I was introduced to it by my undergraduate advisor, [Daniel S. Souza](https://unesp.br/portaldocentes/docentes/394574?lang=en), who suggested it to me after I encounter some problems while compiling Fortran codes in Windows. At that time, my knowledge of it was close to nonexistent. Everything I knew about it was related to its 'difficulty' of use. Quotation marks is just to highlighted this misconception.

### Background

The distribution I used most during this time was [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/), although I initially started with [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). In fact, it was through [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) that I learned about all the flexibility and ease of using the Linux operating system. The first thing that impressed me was how easy it is to install a compiler, in this case, [`gfortran`](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran). A simple command like

```bash
sudo apt install gfortran
```

was all it took to install a Fortran compiler and run code. 

As I was discovering a new world, I decided to test various Linux distributions, including [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/), and, of course, [Debian](https://www.debian.org/). When I first installed [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) around 2017, it did not have easy support for non-free firmware as it does nowadays, particularly with Debian 12 [(Bookworm)](https://www.debian.org/News/2023/20230610). So, I preferred to stick with a ready-to-go distribution because, in the end, what really matters is the work done. After some [distro hopping](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-distro-hopping-is-a-fun-way-to-find-the-perfect-desktop-operating-system/), I ended up with [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/): it's easy to install, aesthetically pleasing (what appealed to me most), based on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), and not so difficult to use.

It being based on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) has the advantage of having all [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) packages out-of-box, but this dependency also has a disadvantage (IMHO): take a while to be updated. Of course, for non-system-related applications, that is not a problem with [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) alongside with [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en). For my use, the most important is stability: I do not want lost time fixing updates that broke the system. I prioritize updated (and stable) kernel, as well as compilers. In the end, it is what matters for me.

Debian 12 has everything: stability, updated kernel and compilers, easy installation, and support of non-free-firmware. It has only one defect: not having Pantheon desktop environment. Anyway, [GNOME 43](https://release.gnome.org/43/) shipped with Debian is sufficient. Below, I will share the post-installation process I have automated using a bash script.

### Setting up the new system

Firstly, as I installed Debian 12 using [`netinst.iso`](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-12.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso), it is required add `$USER` to `sudoers` in order to use `sudo`. To perform this, run the following command:

```bash
su -c '
echo "
# Adding $USER to sudoers
$USER ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
" | tee -a /etc/sudoers > /dev/null'
```

In short, the previous command append the current `$USER` to `sudoers` file in the `/etc/sudoers` directory. Now, `$USER` is able to run `sudo`, necessary to install any package (or any command that request `sudo` privileges). Although the [`netinst.iso`](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-12.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso) downloads almost all packages during the installation, it can be a good move update the system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

Now, we are ready to download all important packages to have the work done. 

```bash
sudo apt install bash-completion vim wget curl htop btop git \
     build-essential gfortran cmake gdb gnome-console geary docker.io \
     gnuplot ruby-dev timeshift inkscape gimp -y
```

The following list presents a brief explanation of each package:

1. `bash-completion`: assists in creating new completions for bash shell
2. `vim`: a powerful yet lightweight terminal-based text editor
3. `wget`: a command-line tool for retrieving files from the internet
4. `curl`: A tool with similar functionality to `wget`
6. `htop`: a useful terminal-based system monitoring
5. `btop`: an enhanced `htop`
6. `git`: a version control system
7. `build-essential`: provides tools for compiling software
8. `gfortran`: a Fortran compiler
9. `cmake`: used for building automation
10. `gdb`: the GNU debugger
11. `gnome-console`: GNOME terminal
12. `geary`: a clean and easy to use e-mail client
13. `docker.io`: used for containerization
14. `gnuplot`: a powerful command-line plotting software
15. `ruby-dev`: provides header files for compiling Ruby (this website is an example)
16. `timeshift`: used for filesystem snapshots for backup purposes
17. `inkscape`: a versatile vector graphics software
18. `gimp`: an image editor

As we are downloading a new terminal and e-mail client, we are going to remove `gnome-terminal` and `evolution`, shipped with GNOME

```bash
sudo apt remove gnome-terminal evolution -y
sudo apt autoremove -y
```
For those using a laptop with fingerprint reader, GNOME offers the option to login and substitute `sudo` password with fingerprint. To this, simply install the following packages:

```bash
sudo apt install fprintd libpam-fprintd -y
```

As I mentioned above, `flatpak` allows one to install updated applications that are not in the system repository while sandboxing them.

```bash
sudo apt install flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

The above command install `flatpak` and a plugin to integrate the applications in GNOME software. Although I rarely use the software store, it can be helpful. The last command adds [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en) to `flapak` repositories, the biggest `flapak` repository.

My computing stack is based on `C/C++` codes alongside `Python` scripts. Thus, we need some packages for it.

```bash
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev libsuitesparse-dev libopenblas-dev -y
```

`libeigen3-dev` installs the `C++` headers files of the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library, a template-based [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) library. `libsuitesparse-dev` provides a set of packages for sparse-matrix-related computing, developed by [Tim Davis](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html). `libopenblas-dev` offers an optimized implementation of the [BLAS](https://www.netlib.org/blas/) library. In summary, these packages are used for linear algebra-related computing in `C++`. In addition to these packages, there is also `petsc-dev`, which is a toolkit for parallel computing. However, I prefer compiling [PETSc](https://petsc.org/) from source, as I have not had a good experience using the repository package

```bash
petsc_dir="$HOME/Desktop"
git clone -b release https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc.git ${petsc_dir}/petsc
cd ${petsc_dir}/petsc
git pull
./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran --download-mpich \
            --download-fblaslapack
make all check
```

First, we define the installation directory `petsc_dir="$HOME/Desktop"`. I prefer to install libraries in the `Desktop` folder, but you can choose any directory, although it is recommend to install it in a directory inside your `$HOME` directory. The following commands clone `petsc` from GitLab, navigate to the created directory, update the repository with `pull`, and finally, configure and build the application. After finishing the installation, you need to set the variable in the `PATH` so that the system recognizes the library. To do this, simply add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export PETSC_DIR=$HOME/Desktop/petsc
export PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux-c-debug
export PATH=$PETSC_DIR/lib/petsc/bin/:$PATH
```

A bash script can easily perform this task for you

```bash
echo "
### >>> PETSc >>>
export PETSC_DIR=$HOME/Desktop/petsc
export PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux-c-debug
export PATH=$PETSC_DIR/lib/petsc/bin/:\$PATH
### <<< PETSc <<<
" | tee -a $HOME/.bashrc > /dev/null
```

Finally, source `.bashrc` file to use [PETSc](https://petsc.org/) bin commands

```bash
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

Let's install some `python` packages now. For system-wide usage, I prefer to install `python` packages from the repository. My current Python usage revolves around numerical packages: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for linear algebra, [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), for algorithms related to scientific computing, [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) for symbolic computing ,and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for graphics plotting.

```bash
sudo apt install ipython3 python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-sympy \
                 python3-matplotlib -y
```

In the list, there is also [`ipython`](https://ipython.org/), which is an interactive shell application to run `python` code.

These packages are not the most updated ones, as Debian freezes the packages versions when releasing a new Debian version. Although `pip` is available in the repository, Debian do recommend to install externally-managed python packages, i.e., packages not managed by Debian maintainers, by using a virtual environment. This can be accomplished as

```bash
python_env_dir="$HOME/Desktop/python"
python3 -m venv ${python_env_dir}
```

Now we can install the latest `python` packages in this virtual environment (venv). To save your time, create a file `requirements.txt` write down all packages you want to have. In my `requirements.txt` file, I have

```text
numpy
scipy
simpy
matplotlib
gmsh
ipython
ipykernel
```
Basically, it is the same packages that were installed system-wide, with the exception of [`gmsh`](https://gmsh.info/), an incredible mesh generator that I use to generate finite element method (FEM) meshes. Then, run the following command

```bash
${python_env_dir}/bin/pip3.11 install -r requirements.txt
```

To automate this process, the following `bash` script perform all of this at once

```bash
python_env_dir="$HOME/Desktop/python"
python3 -m venv ${python_env_dir} 
touch requirements.txt
echo 'numpy
scipy
simpy
matplotlib
gmsh
ipython
ipykernel' >> requirements.txt
${python_env_dir}/bin/pip3.11 install -r requirements.txt
rm requirements.txt
```

To easily activate this venv, let's create an alias for it: `pyenv`

```bash
touch $HOME/.bash_aliases
echo alias pyenv=\""source ${python_env_dir}/bin/activate"\" \
     | tee -a $HOME/.bash_aliases > /dev/null
eval "source $HOME/.bashrc"
```

Now, to activate (and use) this venv, simply type `pyenv` in any terminal. 

To use all these programming-related packages that were installed, you will need a text editor. For me, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the best one. It has a lot of extensions that really help when one is coding. One can download a `.deb` package directly from its website and install it using

```bash
sudo apt install code_version.deb
```

As the goal here is to use bash script to facilitate the post-installation process, the following bash script installs VS Code and also installs the extensions that I use daily

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https gnupg -y
wget -O- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc \
         | sudo gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/vscode.gpg
echo deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/vscode.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main \
         | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code -y
code --install-extension ms-python.python
code --install-extension ms-toolsai.jupyter
code --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools
code --install-extension ms-vscode.cmake-tools
code --install-extension james-yu.latex-workshop
code --install-extension streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker
code --install-extension streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker-portuguese-brazilian
```
The extension names are self-explanatory, so you can easily understand their purposes. To see more extensions, visit its [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode).

To use LaTeX, I highly recommend installing the full version of TeX Live available in the repository

```bash
sudo apt install texlive-full -y
```

If you have a poor internet connection, it might be better to download a full `.iso` file and install it locally. You can find more instructions on the [TeX Live website](https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html).

For those interested in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), installing OpenFOAM is straightforward

```bash
curl https://dl.openfoam.com/add-debian-repo.sh | sudo bash -y
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openfoam-default -y
sudo apt install paraview -y
```

### Customizations

In addition to system-related configurations, I also make a few customizations to my setup: removing the background (I prefer a plain black one), removing the grub wallpaper, and removing the grub splash image (I like to see the components being loaded while booting the system). As usual, a bash script performs all of these tasks at once:

```bash
echo 'set color_normal=light-gray/black
set menu_color_normal=white/black
set menu_color_highlight=black/light-gray"' \
| sudo tee /boot/grub/custom.cfg > /dev/null

echo '
# Remove grub wallpaper
GRUB_BACKGROUND=""

# Remove grub splash image
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""
' | sudo tee -a /etc/default/grub > /dev/null

sudo update-grub
```

### Final configurations

After all setup up, let us take a screenshot of the system for fast and easy restore the system at this point. This is performed by `timeshift`

```bash
sudo timeshift --create --comments "Initial setup"
```

Now, the system is ready to use and secure in case you make a mistake. Although it is not mandatory to reboot the system, it is recommended so that all modifications take effect.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### Plain `bash` script

Below is a plain bash script that automates all the steps explained earlier, making it easy to set up a new machine quickly. To download the script, simply click [here](/assets/bash/debian12_post_installation.sh).
